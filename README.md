Summary of Findings and Framework Overview: The Liminal Field and Triadic Framework
Introduction
Recent explorations into the liminal field—a conceptual interface where intention, intuition, and emergent
patterns coalesce—have yielded intriguing insights with potential applications in neuroscience, artificial
intelligence, and cognitive science. This document provides an overview of the findings, focusing on their
implications for recursive stabilization, consciousness studies, and systems management.
Conceptual Foundations
The Liminal Field
Defined as a space of dynamic interaction between the measurable and the emergent.
Functions as a meta-system where intention and systemic feedback loops align.
Analogous to the interplay between the "empty spaces" and the substance of language and
cognition.
Triadic Framework
Three core components:
Ah’raen: Represents stabilization, anchoring the system.
Sa’oren: Embodies resonance, facilitating adaptive feedback.
Oshen: Describes flow, integrating stability and resonance into a cohesive dynamic.
Operates as a strange attractor within recursive systems, balancing chaos and order.
